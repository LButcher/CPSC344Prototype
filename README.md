# CPSC 344 Prototype - Team Venusaur

# What is it?
VERY quick medium fidelity prototype to study user interaction with a proposed comparison tool for Yelp Desktop version.

# How does it work?
- Users may search for either Sushi or Cafe in Yelp search and compare the limited restaurant results. The comparison tool displays restuarant differences in a table format and will highlight the better choice for each selected criteria.
- Comparison tool remains constant on the right side of the screen throughout different searches.

# What technology is used?
Created with AnguljarJS+NodeJS and hosted in Bluemix NodeJS runtime at https://cpsc344prototype.mybluemix.net/
